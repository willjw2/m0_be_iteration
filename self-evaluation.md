# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
> From what we have learned so far, I am confident

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
> I guess I would say I felt productive struggle, as while there were some hiccups, such as needing to remember to include two ends when putting an if statement inside the each code block and getting straight some of the vocabulary, I felt like I was still effectively making progress.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
> I still need to get more familiar with needing an end after using the each method and if statements, and string interpolation, but I feel like this will come naturally as I get more practice with it.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> No questions, although the pipe characters || reminded me a bit of the math symbol for absolute value, but I see that ruby has a abs() method to return the absolute value of a number.
